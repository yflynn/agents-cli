# Release Notes

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-10

- **Guided brainstorming for new agents.** The workflow skill's Phase 0 is now an interactive brainstorming dialogue that helps you shape an agent's spec before any code is written, and surfaces its assumptions for review when it can't ask.
- `eval generate` and `eval grade` no longer clutter output with benign third-party warnings and progress bars that never affected results. This output is still shown on failure and can be re-enabled for debugging.
- Generated projects now name the default scaffolded eval metric module `tests/eval/response_quality.py` (was `metrics.py`) to match the metric it implements.
- Broad Windows compatibility fixes across the CLI.
- Fixed a command-name typo in user-facing hints so they point to the correct `agents-cli` command.
- Refreshed the bundled skills, including pointing the RAG samples at `core/python/` in `google/adk-samples`.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-30

**Agents CLI is now 1.0 — Generally Available.** This is our first GA release: a stable, production-ready CLI for scaffolding, evaluating, and deploying ADK agents on Google Cloud.

- Redeploys now preserve the existing deployment spec on Agent Runtime and Cloud Run instead of resetting unspecified settings.
- Agent Runtime deploys now honor `.gcloudignore` and `.gitignore` when packaging source, so uploads no longer include ignored files.
- RAG is now a clone-and-study recipe: start from the `rag-vector-search` / `rag-agent-search` samples in `google/adk-samples` (surfaced via the workflow skill). The `agentic_rag` template, the `--datastore` flag, and the `infra datastore` / `data-ingestion` commands were removed and now print a redirect.
- Generated projects now consolidate Python environment configuration into a single templated `.env` file.
- Eval commands now tolerate ADK toolsets when introspecting eval metadata, so agents that use toolsets no longer fail metadata collection.
- GKE Cloud Build deploys are now resilient to log-streaming limits and no longer fail when the build log stream is truncated.
- Refreshed the bundled skills: RAG samples point to `core/` on adk-samples `main`, the always-active workflow skill was generalized and trimmed, and the ADK code guidance notes `streaming_agent_run_with_events` for debugging on Agent Runtime.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-06-28
- `publish gemini-enterprise` now registers Agent Runtime deployments via ADK by default, which Gemini Enterprise invokes natively and reliably. A2A registration remains the default for Cloud Run and GKE; requesting A2A on Agent Runtime now warns and recommends ADK. Re-publishing an A2A agent no longer creates duplicate registrations, and A2A agent cards now carry the correct public URL on the first deploy.
- `agents-cli update` now exits non-zero and clearly reports when a skill fails to update, instead of always printing a misleading green "Skills updated." banner. Also fixes failure messages rendering in the wrong color on Windows PowerShell.
- Refreshed the generated project `uv.lock` files for all templated agents, updating bundled `google-adk` from 2.2.0 to 2.3.0.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-23
- Agent Runtime deploys now serve ADK web, A2A, and the reasoning engine from a single unified container app.
- Cloud Trace spans no longer capture LLM prompts and responses, keeping sensitive content out of traces.
- Refreshed the bundled skills: correctness fixes, de-duplication, and a leaner always-active workflow guide, plus a2ui documented in the ADK code cheatsheet.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-06-18
- Fixed run and playground commands on Windows
  - https://github.com/google/agents-cli/issues/34
  - https://github.com/google/agents-cli/issues/35
  - Thanks to @Abdullah-k0de for discovering and reporting these!
- Fixed stale GCS bucket in failure-investigation guide
- Added Agent Registry fleet management to publish skill

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-15
- `deploy` now surfaces machine-shape parameters as flags for Agent Runtime and Cloud Run.
- `deploy` adds a `--service-name` override.
- `run` prints a copy-pasteable resume command in the session footer.
- `run` no longer tears down a reused local server on a plain run.
- `scaffold upgrade` now builds the prior-version template via `uvx`.
- Skills setup/update no longer hangs on large `npx` output (a pipe-buffer deadlock).
- The project-root notice now only prints when the command actually changes directory.
- Fixed pre-existing inaccuracies in the bundled skills and generated project READMEs.
- Source code is now published to the public GitHub repo: https://github.com/google/agents-cli

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-10
- Scaffolded Python templates now use **ADK 2.0 GA**. New `adk`, `adk_a2a`, and `agentic_rag` projects pin `google-adk[gcp]>=2.0.0,<3.0.0`; the `[gcp]` extra restores the OpenTelemetry GCP exporters and bundles the BigQuery client, so the separate `[bigquery-analytics]` extra is no longer needed. Cloud SQL sessions on Cloud Run and GKE keep working under 2.0. The bundled ADK coding skill and its reference docs were refreshed for 2.0.
  - https://github.com/google/agents-cli/issues/24
- Agent Runtime deploys no longer overwrite a user-supplied `AGENT_VERSION` (or `NUM_WORKERS`) passed via `--update-env-vars`, matching Cloud Run behavior. The "version not found" warning now names the `pyproject.toml` field to set.
- Fixed a stale `deployment/terraform/dev/` path in the Cloud Trace observability guide so it matches the current `single-project` terraform layout.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-06-04
- `eval generate` now works on ADK 2.x projects that use built-in tools such as `VertexAiSearchTool`. Raised the `google-cloud-aiplatform` floor to 1.156.0, which carries the SDK fix.
  - https://github.com/google/agents-cli/issues/27
- Skills installed via `agents-cli setup` are now visible to Antigravity. Global skills are mirrored into the Antigravity skill directories.
  - https://github.com/google/agents-cli/issues/26
- `update` now surfaces errors clearly instead of failing silently.
- Agent deploys tolerate a corrupt or malformed `deployment_metadata.json` instead of crashing.
- Deployment timestamps are now timezone-aware.
- A malformed `AGENTS_CLI_EXPERIMENTS` value no longer crashes the CLI.
- `agents-cli install` now runs with `--locked`, so a drifted `uv.lock` fails fast instead of silently resolving new dependency versions.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-29
### Breaking
- The eval data format changed from ADK `EvalSet` to Vertex AI `EvaluationDataset`. Existing `tests/eval/evalsets/*.evalset.json` files are no longer read by `agents-cli eval generate` and friends. See [Migrating Eval Datasets](docs/src/reference/eval-dataset-migration.md) for the conversion. `scaffold upgrade` now prints a notice when legacy files are detected.

### Eval - Quality Flywheel (preview)
- Added `eval dataset synthesize` for LLM-driven user-simulation dataset generation.
- Added `eval generate` to run agent inference over an `EvaluationDataset` and emit traces.
- Added `eval grade` to score agent traces against built-in or custom metrics.
- Added `eval submit` to submit an end-to-end cloud-side evaluation run on Vertex AI Eval Service.
- Added `eval results` to fetch results from a completed cloud evaluation run.
- Added `eval analyze` for failure-mode analysis over graded results.
- Added `eval metric list` to discover built-in evaluation metrics.
- Rewrote the `eval` skill end-to-end to cover the Quality Flywheel workflow (dataset, generate, grade, analyze, optimize).
